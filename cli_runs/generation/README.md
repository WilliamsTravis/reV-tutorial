Simple Generation Run
===========================

This is a simple set of configs that take a photovoltaic SAM module, run it at several points in Rhode Island for 2012 and 2013 NSRDB data, then average the outputs into a single HDF5 file. To run, simply use the following command in your terminal:

```
reV -c config_pipeline.json pipeline --monitor
```
